# 🧠 Important Concepts Covered

## RTL Simulation

RTL simulation verifies functionality before hardware implementation.

### Key Learnings

* Testbench writing
* Functional verification
* Waveform analysis
* Debugging RTL behavior

---

## Logic Synthesis

Synthesis converts RTL into gate-level hardware using SKY130 standard cells.

### Key Learnings

* Technology mapping
* Logic optimization
* Standard-cell inference
* Timing-aware synthesis

---

## Timing Libraries

The SKY130 Liberty `.lib` files contain:

* Timing information
* Area information
* Leakage power
* Capacitance data
* Transition delays

### Important Concepts

* PVT Analysis
* Setup timing
* Hold timing
* Drive strength optimization

---

## Combinational Optimization

Covered techniques:

* Constant propagation
* Boolean simplification
* Dead logic elimination
* Multi-module optimization

---

## Sequential Optimization

Covered techniques:

* Register optimization
* Counter optimization
* Sequential constant propagation
* Flip-flop inference

---

## Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)

GLS verifies synthesized hardware functionality.

### GLS Flow

```bash
iverilog primitives.v sky130_fd_sc_hd.v synthesized_netlist.v testbench.v
./a.out
gtkwave waveform.vcd
```

### Importance

* Detect synthesis mismatch
* Verify synthesized hardware
* Validate gate-level functionality

---

## Blocking vs Non-Blocking Assignments

### Blocking (`=`)

* Sequential execution
* Mainly used for combinational logic

### Non-Blocking (`<=`)

* Parallel execution
* Mainly used for sequential logic

---

## Latch Inference

Incomplete IF/CASE statements infer latches because outputs retain previous values.

### Important Learning

Always assign outputs under all conditions to avoid unintended latches.

---

## FOR vs FOR GENERATE

| FOR Loop                 | FOR GENERATE              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Behavioral               | Structural                |
| Used inside always block | Used outside always block |
| Logic iteration          | Hardware replication      |
